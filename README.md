# Yatou

*Yet another TCP over UDP*

As the name suggests, this is a toy implementation of TCP to refamiliarize
myself with deeper aspects of the network stack.

As the name does not suggest, I'm attempting to do this using TUN/TAP
functionality, not over UDP, but happen to like `yatou` over `yatat`
¯\_(ツ)_/¯.  The real question here however, is why are you even
reading this README?

### Running

Currently doesn't really do anything and has no tests.

```
make
sudo ./yatou
```
